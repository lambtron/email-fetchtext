fetchtext
==============

Like to share and receive articles by linking to them in emails? On the go and hate waiting for the page to load for you to read the content? CC or forward the email to fetch@to.andyjiang.com to receive an email of just the main text from the link.

## Credits / Thanks

This app uses [node-unfluff](https://github.com/ageitgey/node-unfluff) for the text-from-HTML extraction.

## Example
